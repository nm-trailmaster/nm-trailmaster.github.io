## NM Trailmaster Summary 

Alot of New Mexicans can agree that the true beauty of this state is not fonud in Urban areas, but outside in nature. This app provides information on popular trails in ABQ (including parking options and the best times to visit said trails), It also provides information on some of the more popular camp sites in NM (including phone numbers to those in charge of maintaining these campsites, as well as a list of items you should bring when camping) and most importantly it is building a community of people who want to share their “sacred spots” with other nature-connoisseurs. NM Trailmaster is a gateway to many paths others have walked in our beatiful southwestern landscape.

## Intended Users

* Bored and broke New Mexicans that want to find cheaper ways to entertain themselves.
	> As a working stiff, I’m tired of doing jello-shots at TGI Fridays and then not being able to pay my rent, I need a cheaper way to get my mind off what seems to be my impending doom at the hands of a super-flu.
